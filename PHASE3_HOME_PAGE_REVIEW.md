### 🚀 Next Steps

Once you've reviewed and approved the home page:

1. **Convert Other Pages**:
   - `about.html` → `src/app/about/page.tsx`
   - `resources.html` → `src/app/resources/page.tsx`
   - `events.html` → `src/app/events/page.tsx`
   - `careers.html` → `src/app/careers/page.tsx`
   - `showcase.html` → `src/app/showcase/page.tsx`
   - `what-we-teach.html` → `src/app/what-we-teach/page.tsx`

2. **Migrate API Routes**:
   - `api/create-checkout-session.js` → `src/app/api/create-checkout-session/route.ts`
   - `api/move-past-events.js` → `src/app/api/move-past-events/route.ts`

3. **Handle Login Redirect**:
   - Update `next.config.js` to redirect `/login.html` → `/login`

### 📝 Notes

- The page uses a hybrid approach: server components for static content, client components for interactivity
- All JavaScript functionality has been preserved
- The donation modal and contact form use the same Formspree/Stripe integrations
- Search functionality requires `/search-index.json` in the public folder
- Announcements require `/announcements.json` in the public folder

### 🐛 Known Issues / To Test

- Image optimization: Next.js Image component is used, may need to verify image paths
- Search index: Ensure `/public/search-index.json` exists
- Announcements JSON: Ensure `/public/announcements.json` exists
- Donation API: Needs to be migrated to Next.js API route (currently points to old route)
